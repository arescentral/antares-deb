# Procyon

Procyon is a simple object notation. It's a little more than [JSON][json] and a lot less than [YAML][yaml]. For a complete introduction, see [lang.pn][lang].

[yaml]: http://yaml.org
[lang]: doc/lang.pn

## pnfmt

Procyon notation has a standard style and format. The `pnfmt` tool will automatically convert files to the standard style and rewrap strings for readability.
