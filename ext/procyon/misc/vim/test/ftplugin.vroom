Hard tabs with a tabstop of 2.
  :set filetype=procyon
  > i<Tab># tab<CR><Esc>0C  # space<Esc>
  & 	# tab
  &   # space

  > -jC2<Esc>
  & 	# tab
  &   2



Comments continue on subsequent lines and can be wrapped.
  :set filetype=procyon
  > i# This<CR>is a<CR>comment.<Esc>
  & # This
  & # is a
  & # comment.

  > gqip
  & # This is a comment.



Likewise for wrapped string literals.
  :set filetype=procyon
  > i> Three may keep a secret<CR>if two of them are dead.<Esc>
  & > Three may keep a secret
  & > if two of them are dead.

  > gqip
  & > Three may keep a secret if two of them are dead.



This is broken; it shouldn't be necessary to add a > on the second line.
  :set filetype=procyon
  > i*<Tab>> one<CR>> two<CR>three
  & *	> one
  & 	> two
  & 	> three
