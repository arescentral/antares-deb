About the Code
--------------

You may use the code any way you like, so long as you make the source
available under the GPL. See:
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/GPL/2.0/ for a summary; the complete
text is in the file titled "COPYING".

The code was written in spurts over a long period of time and should be
looked at as more of a creative work than an engineering project. Please
don't ask me about it, and especially don't ask Ambrosia.

Good luck.


A Request
---------

Please use "OpenAres" or some other alternative instead of just "Ares"
in the title of any derivative works. If I decide to create a new game
based on Ares, I'd rather not have it confused with derivatives of my
prior work. Therefore I wish to strongly discourage the release of
additional games called "Ares" which may be interpreted as my own.

For example, it would make me unhappy to have someone else release
something called "Ares 2."


The Media
---------

The media files, including all images, sounds, and music, are not
covered by this license. I retain the copyright to the media, and the
license to the source code does not grant you a right to redistribute
the media files in any form.

This does not preclude you from programmatically making use of existing
legal distributions of the media, e.g. extracting data from the original
data files at runtime and storing them locally.
